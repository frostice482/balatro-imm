## Developers

If your mod is not included, make sure your mod exists in `balatro-mod-index` and that your repo contains a valid metadata file.
See [here](https://github.com/frostice482/balatro-mod-index-tiny?tab=readme-ov-file#why-is-my-mod-not-included) for details.

For mod releases, please make sure to use the Github Releases.
I recommend that you name your tags based on your mod version, with some conversion:
- Mod version `~` is converted to `-` (e.g. `1.0.0~alpha-1` -> `1.0.0-alpha-5`)
- Tag version with leading `v` is ignored (e.g. `v1.0.0` -> `1.0.0`)
