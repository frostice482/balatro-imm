The ingame mod browser for Balatro.

## Installation

### Normal Installation

1.  Install [lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation).

3.  Download [inmodman.zip](https://github.com/frostice482/balatro-imm/releases/latest/download/inmodman.zip)

4.  Extract the zip to `Mods/imm`.
    The `Mods/imm` folder should now contain `manifest.json`.

    If you cannot find the save file, see [this section](#finding-mods-folder).

### Bundled Installation

This is meant as a quick way to install imm, and does not require lovely installation.
Be noted that this method will cause issues with some mods, and will just not work in all platform.

Windows:
```sh
curl -SL "https://github.com/frostice482/balatro-imm/releases/latest/download/bundle.lua" -o "%appdata%\Balatro\main.lua" && start "" "steam://launch/2379780"
```

### Finding Mods Folder

Windows: `%appdata%\Balatro\Mods`

Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Balatro/Mods`

Linux with Steam Proton:

-   Find your Steam installation path

    - `~/.local/share/Steam`
    - Snap installation: `~/snap/steam/common/.local/share/Steam`
    - Flatpak installation: `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam`

Config is formatted in a `key=value` pair.

### `noHandleEarlyError`

Disables imm's early crash handing.

### `init`

Internally used to mark for non-first game launch.

### `githubToken`

Allows player to specify the GitHub API token.
This is used to increase the 60/hour ratelimit, when getting mod releases in Balatro Mod Index.

### `nextEnable`

Internally used when Balatro crashes at loading and it disables all mods.

Determines what mod to enable at the next loading.
The entry is mod ID and version separated by `=` (includes surrounding whitespaces).
The list is separated by `==` (includes surrounding whitespaces).
e.g. `Steamodded=1.0.0~beta-0827c == Cryptid=0.5.12a`

## Developers

If your mod is not included, make sure your mod exists in `balatro-mod-index` and that your repo contains a valid metadata file.
See [here](https://github.com/frostice482/balatro-mod-index-tiny?tab=readme-ov-file#why-is-my-mod-not-included) for details.

For mod releases, please make sure to use the Github Releases.
I recommend that you name your tags based on your mod version, with some conversion:
- Mod version `~` is converted to `-` (e.g. `1.0.0~alpha-1` -> `1.0.0-alpha-5`)
- Tag version with leading `v` is ignored (e.g. `v1.0.0` -> `1.0.0`)
